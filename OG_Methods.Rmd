## R Markdown


```{r load-df}
b <- readRDS(here("Data", "Derived-data", "DFs", "OG", "OG_082823.Rds"))

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
