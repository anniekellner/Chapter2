This study includes a subset of GPS-collared bears that spent ≥ 7 consecutive days on land between June 1 and September 30 of any given year. Bears with insufficient data (< 100 total points) were excluded. In total, our analysis includes tracking data from 21 bear-summers (19 individuals including two bears with data from two separate years) over eight calendar years (2005, 2008-9, 2011 – 2015). Bears were tracked for an average of 52 days (range: 26 – 78, σ = 14).

b <- readRDS('./Data/Derived-data/DFs/bears_ch2_110622.Rds')

b1 <- b %>% 
  select(animal, year) %>%
  distinct(animal, year) %>%
  arrange(year)

kable(b1)

## include start date, end date, days tracked
